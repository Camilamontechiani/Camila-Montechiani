Hi! üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm Camila Montechiani, a front-end developer looking for my first opportunity in the IT world.

I recently completed an intensive full-stack web development course at Soy Henry, where I gained solid knowledge and skills in both front-end and back-end development.

üìã During my training and development experience, I participated in various projects that allowed me to apply modern technologies and tackle real-world software development challenges.

One of the most comprehensive projects was a scheduling system for a hospital. On the back-end, I used PostgreSQL, TypeScript, Node.js, TypeORM, and Express. On the front-end, I worked with React, utilizing Formik for form creation and Redux for global state management, enabling efficient handling of appointment and patient information.

Additionally, I developed two other projects focused on the front-end using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Figma for project structuring, and TypeScript. In one of them, I implemented Zustand for global state management, integrated JWT authentication in Next.js, and deployed the application on Vercel. In one of these projects, I collaborated with a team, which allowed me to learn about teamwork, code review, and agile methodologies.

These experiences have been essential in strengthening my technical skills and learning to collaborate in dynamic environments, adapting to project needs, and always seeking the best solutions.
